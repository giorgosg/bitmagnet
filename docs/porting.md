# Porting from forks and upstream PRs

How to measure a fork honestly, read its diff without drowning in generated output, and
get one coherent change onto a topic branch. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#branches) owns the
branch rules and the red-test bar; this page is the commands.

## Remotes

Configured locally, not part of the repo — re-run on a fresh clone:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bitmagnet-io/bitmagnet.git
git remote add o51r15            https://github.com/o51r15/bitmagnet.git
git remote add lodestone         https://github.com/ghobs91/lodestone.git
git remote add niklas2233        https://github.com/niklas2233/bitmagnet.git
git remote add kawaii-not-kawaii https://github.com/kawaii-not-kawaii/bitmagnet.git
git remote add gabriel20xx       https://github.com/gabriel20xx/bitmagnet.git
git remote add nigowl            https://github.com/nigowl/bitmagnet.git
git remote add dashed            https://github.com/dashed/bitmagnet.git
```

All upstream PR heads, without a remote per contributor:

```bash
git config --add remote.upstream.fetch '+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/upstream-pr/*'
git fetch upstream
# every open PR is now available as upstream-pr/<number>
git log --oneline upstream/main..upstream-pr/510
```

`.git` is ~900 MB with all forks fetched.

## The three measurements that lie

All three have the same root cause: **most of these forks rebase onto upstream rather
than merging**, so their commits carry new SHAs and their merge-base with `main` is the
original 2023 fork point. Each of these has cost real time.

### 1. GitHub's ahead/behind

`behind_by` counts SHA reachability, so a fork that rebased shows as hundreds of commits
behind while containing all of upstream's work. lodestone reported _209 behind_ and was
missing exactly one upstream commit.

Measure patch equivalence instead:

```bash
git cherry upstream/main FORK/main | grep -c '^+'   # genuinely new work
git cherry FORK/main upstream/main | grep -c '^+'   # genuinely missing from upstream
```

### 2. Three-dot diffs

`git diff upstream/main...FORK/main` diffs from the **merge base**, which for these forks
is `ce8909db` (2023-10-05). You get three years of upstream history mixed into the fork's
changes.

**Use two-dot** — `git diff upstream/main FORK/main` — for every fork comparison.

### 3. Raw diffstats

Whitespace and line endings inflate everything. o51r15 converted the whole tree to CRLF:
its Go diff reads as 507 files / +77k / −72k, and **normalized** it is 65 files /
+4,920 / −26. lodestone renamed the Go module, so ~300 of its 319 changed Go files are
import-line churn.

Always pass `-w --ignore-cr-at-eol`.

## The review command

Go only, generated output excluded:

```bash
git diff -w --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat upstream/main FORK/main -- \
  '*.go' ':(exclude)*.gen.go' ':(exclude)*/mocks/*' ':(exclude)*.pb.go'
```

Everything including the UI, with the committed build output excluded:

```bash
git diff -w --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat upstream/main FORK/main -- \
  . ':(exclude)webui/dist' ':(exclude)webui/src/app/i18n/translations' \
    ':(exclude)go.sum' ':(exclude)*package-lock.json'
```

Worth an alias:

```bash
git config alias.forkdiff '!f() { git diff -w --ignore-cr-at-eol "${2:-upstream/main}" "$1" -- . ":(exclude)webui/dist" ":(exclude)webui/src/app/i18n/translations" ":(exclude)go.sum" ":(exclude)*package-lock.json"; }; f'
# git forkdiff lodestone/main
```

Read the whole substantive diff that comes back. A fork's commit message states intent,
not behaviour.

## Measuring what a subsystem actually costs to port

Before porting a whole subsystem, measure its **import closure**, not its line count. The
method, from the `internal/auth` port:

1. Extract every import across all files of the package.
2. Walk the closure, descending **only** into packages the target lineage does not already
   provide.
3. Stop where it terminates, and count what has to come along.

`internal/auth` imports just six bitmagnet packages directly. Closing over those, five
support packages had to be ported alongside it — about 3,000 lines on top of the
subsystem's own 4,100 — and the closure **terminated there**, reaching nothing in the
plugin registry, the GraphQL layer or the wasm host. An earlier estimate had claimed the
subsystem could not be extracted without taking the source lineage wholesale. It was
wrong, and the whole difference was step 2.

**Measure against the lineage you are porting _to_.** Walking the source lineage's own
copies of shared packages such as `internal/database` and `internal/model` drags in
everything they depend on there — an artefact of measuring the wrong thing, since those
packages already exist on the target.

Two signals worth collecting while you are there. New third-party modules are a real cost
and are invisible in a diffstat. And where the port includes generated code, regenerating
it on the target is the strongest evidence the extraction is faithful: the auth model and
dao types came out byte-identical to the source lineage's after `task gen-gorm`.

## Taking the change

One topic branch per feature, based on `upstream/main`:

```bash
git switch -c feat/dht-rate-limit upstream/main
git cherry-pick -x <sha>          # -x records the source commit
```

When the fork carries CRLF or module-rename churn, take the patch rather than the commit
— cherry-picking drags the churn with it:

```bash
git diff -w upstream/main o51r15/main -- internal/prowlarr | git apply -3
```

Then renumber any migration the fork added, and give the change a test seen **red**
before it goes anywhere. Record the outcome — accepted, deferred, or rejected with the
reason — in [integration-status.md](integration-status.md).
